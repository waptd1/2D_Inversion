Associated codes:

1. dispersioncode.m - This code generates the dispersion image for a given experimental signal data acquired in field. It also contains code to extract predominant mode. 

2. inversion_ga.m - This code contains the code to carry out the inversion for central profile using genetic algorithm.

3. inversion_sa.m - This code contains the code to carry out the inversion for side profile using simulated annealing.

4*. Inversion_CFEM.m - This code is called through inversion_ga.m and inversion_sa.m, and it calculates the theoretical multiple modes and  predominant mode. NOTE: The observed/experimental predominant mode, acquisition parameters, Poisson's ratio, and density vector has to be updated within the code before running the inversion_ga or inversion_sa.

5. Misfit.m - This function is called within the Inversion_CFEM.m to calculate the misfit error (E) between the experimental and theoretical predominant mode. 

6. gaoutfun.m - This code produces all the profiles calculated during each generation during inversion via genetic algorithm (inversion_ga.m).

7. profile.m - This code is used to generate plot of obtained Vs profile.

8. Vs_2D.m - This code is used to generate a plot of 2D inverted profile (subsurface image).

9. fwd_vert_disp.m - This code is used to generate a plot of maximum vertical downward displacement for experimental and synthetic (dynamic FE simulated) data. 



Note: Please keep all the code files in the same folder. Relevant comments and instructions have been provided within the code and must be followed for smooth and error-free run.
